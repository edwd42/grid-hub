    Embedded Socrata Chart
  </h1>
  <p>
    Hello! This page is a chart I made on the Providence Open Data Portal. It is
    a Socrata chart loaded in an iframe. I can't believe how incredibly easy it
    is to embed a chart into an Angular app. I've got to do more of these! Stay
    tuned, and come back soon!
    <br />
    Please note: if this page appears blank, it is because Socrata.com requies
    an app token and is expired.
